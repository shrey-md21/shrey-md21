## Hi, I'm Shreyas!

I'm a software engineer focused on **low-level systems, cloud platforms, and enterprise software**.  
I work with **Java, Python, and Rust**, and have built scalable products such as **Shepherd Watch** (an endpoint device management software) and **SmartGraph** (a social graph network for 0-1 startups).
